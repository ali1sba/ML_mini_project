## Overview

This repository contains a mini machine learning project where three algorithms are implemented from scratch:

- **One Rule (OneR)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

The purpose of this project is to understand the foundational concepts of these algorithms by implementing them without using any external machine learning libraries.
